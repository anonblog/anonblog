Soon I will host an anonymous blog with GitHub Pages. This is my readme file that will be used to introduce myself.

Hi, I am anonblog. You do not know my name or place or anything about me, probably. I am anonymous. I am not the group called Anonymous, I'm an anonymous person on the Internet.

More details when the blog is done at anonblog.github.io
